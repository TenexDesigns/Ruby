Improving your skills in Ruby programming involves understanding design patterns and problem-solving techniques specific to the language. Let's explore some of these concepts:

#### Design Patterns
Design patterns are solutions to common problems in software design. They represent the best practices used by experienced developers, which can be used to improve the structure and efficiency of your code.

1. **Composite Pattern**: This pattern allows you to compose objects into tree structures and then work with these structures as if they were individual objects. This can be particularly useful when dealing with hierarchical data structures [Source 0](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/ruby).

2. **Singleton Pattern**: This pattern restricts the instantiation of a class to a single instance. It is used when a class needs to have exactly one instance, no more, no less [Source 8](https://betterprogramming.pub/design-pattern-1-singleton-308c896801d7).

3. **Pattern Matching**: Introduced in Ruby 2.7, pattern matching is a feature that can help simplify your code and make it more readable. It allows you to test a value against a pattern and execute code accordingly. Here is an example of how to use pattern matching in Ruby [Source 4](https://www.toptal.com/ruby/ruby-pattern-matching-tutorial):

```ruby
def display_name(name_hash)
  case name_hash
  in {username: username}
    username
  in {nickname: nickname, realname: {first: first, last: last}}
    "#{nickname} #{first} #{last}"
  in {first: first, last: last}
    "#{first} #{last}"
  else
    'New User'
  end
end
```

#### Problem Solving Techniques
Understanding problem-solving techniques can help you tackle complex problems more effectively.

1. **Backtracking**: This is a general algorithm for finding all solutions to some problems, particularly constraint satisfaction problems. It incrementally builds candidates to the solutions and abandons a candidate ('backtracks') as soon as it determines that the candidate cannot be extended to a valid solution [Source 15](https://reintech.io/blog/solving-complex-problems-with-ruby).

2. **Divide and Conquer**: This algorithm design paradigm tackles complex problems by recursively breaking them down into smaller subproblems until they become simple enough to solve directly. The solutions to the subproblems are then combined to form the solution to the original problem [Source 15](https://reintech.io/blog/solving-complex-problems-with-ruby).

3. **Coding Challenges**: Solving coding challenges is a great way to improve your Ruby and problem-solving skills. It allows you to focus on solving specific problems, explore interesting language features, and become a better Ruby developer [Source 16](https://www.rubyguides.com/2018/11/coding-challenges/).

To improve your skills further, consider online tutorials and resources such as Codecademy and FreeCodeCamp which offer comprehensive courses on Ruby [Source 12](https://stackify.com/ruby-tutorials/).
