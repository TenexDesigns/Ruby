In Ruby, a hash is a data structure that stores a collection of key-value pairs.
It provides an efficient way to retrieve and manipulate data based on unique keys.
Heres an explanation of hashes in Ruby with code samples:

Creating Hashes:

Hashes can be created using curly braces ({}) or the Hash.new constructor.
Example:

student = { 'name' => 'John', 'age' => 25, 'grade' => 'A' }

scores = Hash.new
scores['math'] = 90
scores['science'] = 85
scores['history'] = 92




Accessing Hash Elements:

Hash elements are accessed using their keys.
You can retrieve a value by specifying the key within square brackets ([]).
Example:
ruby
Copy code
student = { 'name' => 'John', 'age' => 25, 'grade' => 'A' }

puts student['name']     # Output: John

puts student['age']      # Output: 25




Modifying Hash Elements:

You can modify the value of an existing key or add new key-value pairs to a hash.
Example:
ruby
Copy code
student = { 'name' => 'John', 'age' => 25, 'grade' => 'A' }

student['grade'] = 'B'   # Modify existing value

student['city'] = 'New York'   # Add new key-value pair

puts student.inspect     # Output: {"name"=>"John", "age"=>25, "grade"=>"B", "city"=>"New York"}







Types of Hash Keys:

In Ruby, you can use various types of objects as keys in a hash, including strings, symbols, integers, and even objects.
Symbols are commonly used as keys in hashes because they are immutable and provide faster access compared to strings.
Example:
ruby
Copy code
scores = { math: 90, science: 85, history: 92 }

puts scores[:math]      # Output: 90

person = { name: 'John', age: 25 }

puts person[:name]      # Output: John







Differences between Hashes and Arrays:

Arrays store elements in an ordered sequence using integer indices, while hashes use keys to associate values.
Hashes provide a more meaningful way to access and manipulate data using custom keys.
Arrays are useful when the order of elements matters, while hashes are ideal for representing structured data with key-value pairs.
Example:

fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange']
fruit_hash = { 'first' => 'apple', 'second' => 'banana', 'third' => 'orange' }






Hash Methods:

Ruby provides a set of methods to work with hashes, such as keys, values, each, delete, merge, and more.
These methods allow you to retrieve keys or values, iterate over hash elements, delete key-value pairs,
merge hashes, and perform other operations.
Example:

scores = { math: 90, science: 85, history: 92 }

keys = scores.keys             # Get all keys as an array

values = scores.values         # Get all values as an array

scores.each { |subject, score| puts "#{subject}: #{score}" }   # Iterate over each key-value pair

scores.delete(:science)        # Delete a key-value pair

merged = scores.merge({ english: 88, physics: 91 })            # Merge two hashes
Hashes are versatile and widely used in Ruby to represent structured data and provide fast lookup based on unique keys.
They allow you to organize and access data in a more meaningful and efficient manner compared to arrays.

Hashes in Ruby are data structures used to store data in the form of unique key-value pairs.
Unlike arrays, there are no numerical indexes; you access the hash values with keys rubyguides.com.
Hashes are sometimes called associative arrays because they associate values with each key geeksforgeeks.org.

To create a hash, you can use the hash literal, which is a comma-separated list of key-value pairs enclosed within curly braces {}:

country_codes = {
  "Spain" => "ES",
  "France" => "FR",
  "Germany" => "DE"
}
You can also create a hash using the Hash.new method:

geeks = Hash.new("GFG")
geeks["Ruby"] = "Geeks"
In this example, "GFG" is the default value for the hash. 
When a key or value doest exist in the hash, accessing the hash will return the default value "GFG".

You can access hash values using keys:

puts country_codes["France"] # Output: FR
puts geeks["Ruby"] # Output: Geeks
You can use different types of keys in a hash, such as strings, symbols, and even objects:

hash_with_symbols = {
  :key1 => "value1",
  :key2 => "value2",
  :key3 => "value3"
}

hash_with_objects = {
  obj1: "value1",
  obj2: "value2",
  obj3: "value3"
}
Accessing hash values with symbols:

puts hash_with_symbols[:key1] # Output: value1
puts hash_with_objects[:obj1] # Output: value1
The main differences between arrays and hashes are:

Arrays use numerical indexes for access, while hashes use keys.
Arrays always use integers for indexing, while hashes use objects for indexing.
Arrays are suitable for ordered data, while hashes are suitable for associative data.
To access and manipulate hashes, you can use various methods like each, delete, update, and merge.

Sure, here are some examples of how to use hashes in Ruby:

Ruby
# Create a hash with some key-value pairs
person = {
  name: "John Doe",
  age: 30,
  occupation: "Software Engineer"
}

# Access a value in the hash
puts person[:name] # => "John Doe"

# Add a new key-value pair to the hash
person[:email] = "johndoe@example.com"

# Remove a key-value pair from the hash
person.delete(:age)

# Iterate over the hash
person.each do |key, value|
  puts "#{key} => #{value}"
end

Output:

Code snippet
name => John Doe
occupation => Software Engineer
email => johndoe@example.com

Here are some additional things to note about hashes in Ruby:

Hashes are a collection of key-value pairs.
Keys can be any type of object, including numbers, strings, symbols, and even objects of your own custom class.
Values can be any type of object, including numbers, strings, arrays, hashes, and even objects of your own custom class.
Hashes are unordered, so there is no guarantee that the order of the key-value pairs will be the same each time you access the hash.
Hashes are mutable, so you can add, remove, and update key-value pairs as needed.
Hashes have a number of methods that you can use to manipulate them.
For example, you can use the each method to iterate over the key-value pairs in a hash, 
the keys method to get a list of all the keys in a hash, and the values method to get a list of all the values in a hash.
Here are some differences between hashes and arrays in Ruby:

Hashes are unordered, while arrays are ordered.
Hashes can contain any type of object as a key, while arrays can only contain numbers or strings as indices.
Hashes are mutable, while arrays are immutable.
Here are some other relevant things to know about hashes in Ruby:

Hashes are often used to store data in a way that is easy to look up.
For example, you could use a hash to store the names and ages of all of your friends.
Hashes can be used to implement many different data structures, such as dictionaries, maps, and sets.
Hashes are a powerful tool that can be used to store and manipulate data in Ruby.
I hope this helps!
