In Ruby, instance variables (e.g., `@name` and `@age`) and attribute accessors (e.g., `attr_accessor :name, :age`) are two different ways to handle attributes within a class. Each approach has its own advantages and use cases.

1. **Instance Variables (`@name`, `@age`)**:
   - Instance variables are private by default, meaning they are accessible only within the class that defines them.
   - They can be accessed and modified through getter and setter methods.
   - You can customize the behavior of getter and setter methods if needed.
   
   Example:

   ```ruby
   class Person
     def initialize(name, age)
       @name = name
       @age = age
     end

     def name
       @name
     end

     def name=(new_name)
       @name = new_name
     end
   end

   person = Person.new("Alice", 30)
   puts person.name  # Accessing the name attribute
   person.name = "Bob"  # Modifying the name attribute
   ```

2. **Attribute Accessors (`attr_accessor :name, :age`)**:
   - `attr_accessor` is a Ruby macro that generates getter and setter methods for attributes.
   - It simplifies the creation of getter and setter methods for instance variables.
   - Attributes defined with `attr_accessor` are public and can be accessed from outside the class.

   Example:

   ```ruby
   class Person
     attr_accessor :name, :age

     def initialize(name, age)
       @name = name
       @age = age
     end
   end

   person = Person.new("Alice", 30)
   puts person.name  # Accessing the name attribute
   person.name = "Bob"  # Modifying the name attribute
   ```

The key difference is that `attr_accessor` simplifies the creation of getter and setter methods for instance variables and makes them public by default. When you use `@name` and `@age` without `attr_accessor`, you have more control over encapsulation and can define custom getter and setter methods. The choice between these two approaches depends on your specific needs for encapsulation and access control.

Using `attr_accessor` is a common and convenient way to define attributes, especially when you want to provide read and write access to instance variables. However, for more complex attribute behaviors or access control, custom getter and setter methods are often used.
