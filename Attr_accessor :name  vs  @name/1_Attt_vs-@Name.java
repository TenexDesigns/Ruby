The `@name` and `@age` variables are instance variables. Instance variables are variables that belong to individual objects. They are prefixed with an `@` symbol.

The `attr_accessor :name, :age` code is a metaprogramming shortcut that creates both getter and setter methods for the `name` and `age` instance variables. This means that you can read and write the values of the `name` and `age` instance variables using the `name` and `age` methods, respectively.

Here is an example of how to use instance variables:

```ruby
class Person
  def initialize(name, age)
    @name = name
    @age = age
  end

  def name
    @name
  end

  def age
    @age
  end
end

person = Person.new("Bard", 24)

# Read the value of the name instance variable
puts person.name

# Read the value of the age instance variable
puts person.age
```

Output:

```
Bard
24
```

Here is an example of how to use the `attr_accessor` shortcut:

```ruby
class Person
  attr_accessor :name, :age

  def initialize(name, age)
    self.name = name
    self.age = age
  end
end

person = Person.new("Bard", 24)

# Read the value of the name instance variable
puts person.name

# Write the value of the name instance variable
person.name = "Bard the Large Language Model"

# Read the value of the name instance variable again
puts person.name

# Read the value of the age instance variable
puts person.age

# Write the value of the age instance variable
person.age = 25

# Read the value of the age instance variable again
puts person.age
```

Output:

```
Bard
Bard the Large Language Model
24
25
```

The main difference between using instance variables directly and using the `attr_accessor` shortcut is that the `attr_accessor` shortcut creates getter and setter methods for you. This can make your code more concise and readable.

However, it is important to note that the `attr_accessor` shortcut can also be dangerous. If you are not careful, you can accidentally create getter and setter methods for instance variables that you do not want to be public.

In general, it is best to use the `attr_accessor` shortcut when you need to create getter and setter methods for multiple instance variables at the same time. If you only need to create a getter and setter method for a single instance variable, it is usually better to define the method yourself.
