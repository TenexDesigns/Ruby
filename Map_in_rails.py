In Rails (which is built on top of Ruby), the map method is used to iterate over a
collection (such as an array or a hash) and apply a transformation to each element.
It returns a new collection with the transformed values.
Heres a breakdown of how the map method works:

Syntax:


new_collection = original_collection.map { |element| block }
Explanation:

original_collection: The collection (array or hash) over which you want to iterate.
element: The current element being processed during each iteration.
block: A block of code that defines the transformation to be applied to each element.
  It can be written using either a curly brace {} or a do...end block.
Example 1 - Array:


numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squared_numbers = numbers.map { |num| num * num }

puts squared_numbers
# Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
In the above example, the map method is used to square each element in the numbers array,
resulting in a new array squared_numbers.

Example 2 - Hash:


people = [
  { name: 'Alice', age: 25 },
  { name: 'Bob', age: 30 },
  { name: 'Charlie', age: 35 }
]
names = people.map { |person| person[:name] }

puts names
# Output: ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie']
In this example, the map method is used to extract the name attribute from each hash in the people array,
resulting in a new array names.

The map method is useful when you need to transform the elements of a collection based on a 
specific logic or perform a calculation on each element. It simplifies the process of iterating over
a collection and building a new collection with the transformed values.

The map method in the context of Rails is not directly related to associations or routing,
but rather a method from the Ruby language itself. 
The map method is an enumerable method in Ruby that allows you to transform an 
array or collection by applying a given block of code to each element in the collection and
returning a new array with the transformed elements.

Heres a simple example of using the map method in Ruby:

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squares = numbers.map { |number| number * number }
puts squares.inspect
# Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
In the example above, the map method iterates over the numbers array and applies the given 
block (multiplying each number by itself) to create a new array squares containing the squares of the original numbers.

In the context of Rails, you might use the map method to transform data before returning it in your API response.
For example, if you have a Post model with a has_many association to comments,
you could use the map method to extract only the comment content:

# app/controllers/v1/posts_controller.rb
class V1::PostsController < ApplicationController
  def show
    post = Post.find(params[:id])
    comment_contents = post.comments.map { |comment| comment.content }
    render json: { post: post, comments: comment_contents }
  end
end

In this example, the map method is used to create a new array comment_contents containing
only the content of each comment associated with the post.
