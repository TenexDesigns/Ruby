In Ruby, the `->` (dash rocket) is used to define a lambda, which is a type of anonymous function. Lambdas are used to create reusable blocks of code and can take parameters. The `->` syntax is commonly referred to as the "stabby lambda" or "lambda literal" syntax.

Here's the basic syntax for defining a lambda using `->`:

```ruby
my_lambda = -> (parameter1, parameter2) { # code here }
```

- `my_lambda` is the variable that holds the lambda.
- `->` is the dash rocket syntax for defining a lambda.
- `(parameter1, parameter2)` specifies the parameters that the lambda takes. These parameters can be used in the lambda's code block.
- `{ # code here }` is the body of the lambda, where you place the code to be executed when the lambda is called.

Lambdas are similar to blocks but have some differences, such as allowing parameters and having a more explicit syntax.

In the context of Ruby on Rails, you often encounter lambdas used for various purposes, including defining query scopes, custom validations, and callback functions. They are a powerful tool for encapsulating and reusing blocks of code.







  --------------------------


The `->` (dash rocket) syntax in Ruby is called a lambda or a lambda literal. It is used to define an anonymous function or a block of code that can be assigned to a variable or passed as an argument to a method.

Here's an example of using the `->` syntax to define a lambda:

ruby
greeting = -> { puts "Hello, world!" }
greeting.call


In this example, we define a lambda called `greeting` that prints "Hello, world!". We can then call the lambda using the `call` method.

Lambdas can also take arguments:

```ruby
addition = -> (a, b) { a + b }
result = addition.call(3, 4)
puts result
```

In this example, we define a lambda called `addition` that takes two arguments `a` and `b` and returns their sum. We call the lambda with arguments `3` and `4`, and the result is `7`.

In Ruby on Rails, the `->` syntax is commonly used with scopes, as shown in the previous example. Scopes are defined using lambdas to encapsulate query conditions.

Lambdas provide a concise way to define small, reusable blocks of code. They are similar to blocks and Procs in Ruby, but with some differences in behavior, such as how they handle return statements and arguments.

Note that in Ruby 1.9 and later versions, you can also use the `lambda` keyword instead of `->` to define a lambda:

```ruby
greeting = lambda { puts "Hello, world!" }
```

Both `->` and `lambda` syntaxes are equivalent and can be used interchangeably.
