In Ruby, `||=` is a compound assignment operator that is used for conditional assignment. It's often used to set a variable to a particular value if and only if that variable is currently `nil` or `false`. It's a concise way of initializing a variable only if it hasn't been assigned a "truthy" value.

Here's how it works:

```ruby
x ||= y
```

This code can be read as "if `x` is falsy (i.e., `nil` or `false`), assign the value of `y` to `x`."

Here are a couple of common use cases:

1. **Initializing a Variable**: You can use `||=` to initialize a variable if it hasn't been assigned a value yet. This is particularly useful for setting default values in methods:

    ```ruby
    def greet(name)
      name ||= "Stranger"
      puts "Hello, #{name}!"
    end
    ```

    If `name` is not provided, it will default to "Stranger."

2. **Caching and Memoization**: It's also used for caching or memoization. For example, to cache the result of an expensive operation the first time it's calculated:

    ```ruby
    def calculate_expensive_result
      @result ||= perform_expensive_calculation
    end
    ```

    The first time `calculate_expensive_result` is called, it will perform the calculation. Subsequent calls will return the cached result.

In Rails, you might encounter this operator when working with instance variables in controllers, especially when caching or memoizing values to reduce redundant calculations in your views.

Here's a typical example in a Rails controller:

```ruby
class PostsController < ApplicationController
  def show
    @post ||= Post.find(params[:id])
  end
end
```

In this example, `@post` will be assigned the result of `Post.find(params[:id])` only if it's currently `nil`. If `@post` is not `nil`, it retains its previous value, reducing the need to query the database if it's already been loaded.

In summary, `||=` is a convenient way to set a variable's value based on a condition, and it's often used for initialization, caching, and memoization in both Ruby and Rails.
