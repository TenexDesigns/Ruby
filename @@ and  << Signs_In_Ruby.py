In Ruby, @@ is used to declare a class variable, which is shared among all instances of a class, 
while << is the concatenation operator used to append or add elements to an object. Let's explore their usage:

@@ - Class Variables:

Class variables are prefixed with @@ and are shared by all instances of a class.

They hold values that are common to the class and can be accessed and modified by both class methods and instance methods.

Example:


class Counter
  @@count = 0

  def initialize
    @@count += 1
  end

  def self.get_count
    @@count
  end
end

# Creating instances of the Counter class
c1 = Counter.new
c2 = Counter.new

puts Counter.get_count #=> 2
In this example, the @@count class variable is used to keep track of the number of instances created. 
Every time a new instance of the Counter class is created, the initialize method increments the @@count variable by 1. 
The class method get_count returns the current value of @@count, giving the total count of instances created.

<< - Concatenation Operator:

In Ruby, << is primarily used as the concatenation operator for strings or arrays.
It appends or adds elements to an object.

Example:


str = "Hello, "
str << "world!"
puts str #=> "Hello, world!"

arr = [1, 2, 3]
arr << 4
puts arr.inspect #=> [1, 2, 3, 4]
In the first example, the << operator is used to concatenate the string "Hello, " with the string "world!",
resulting in the string "Hello, world!".

In the second example, << is used to add the number 4 to the end of the array, modifying it in place.

Both @@ and << have specific meanings and uses in Ruby:

@@ is used to declare and access class variables, which are shared by all instances of a class.
<< is the concatenation operator that appends or adds elements to an object, such as strings or arrays.
Understanding the context in which these symbols are used is crucial for correctly interpreting
and utilizing them in your Ruby code.

The double at sign (@@) in Ruby is used to declare a class variable. 
A class variable is a variable that is shared by all instances of a class.
The single at sign (@) in Ruby is used to declare an instance variable.
An instance variable is a variable that is unique to each instance of a class.

The << operator in Ruby is used to append an object to an array. For example, 
the following code will append the string "hello" to the array arr:

Code snippet
arr << "hello"
Use code with caution. Learn more
The << operator can also be used to concatenate strings. For example, the following 
code will concatenate the strings "hello" and "world":

Code snippet
"hello" << "world"
Use code with caution. Learn more
Here are some examples of how @@ and << can be used in Ruby:

Declaring a class variable:
Code snippet
class User
  @@count = 0
end


Incrementing the class variable @@count:
Code snippet
User.count += 1
Use code with caution. Learn more
Accessing the class variable @@count:
Code snippet
puts User.count





Declaring an instance variable:
Code snippet
class User
  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end
end
Use code with caution. Learn more



Setting the instance variable @name:
Code snippet
user = User.new("John Doe")
user.name = "Jane Doe"
Use code with caution. Learn more
Accessing the instance variable @name:
Code snippet
puts user.name
Use code with caution. Learn more





Appending an object to an array:
Code snippet
arr = []
arr << "hello"
arr << "world"
Use code with caution. Learn more
Concatenating strings:
Code snippet
str1 = "hello"
str2 = "world"
str1 << str2
