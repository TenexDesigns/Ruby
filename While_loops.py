In Ruby, a while loop is used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a given condition is true.
The loop continues executing until the condition becomes false. Heres an explanation of while loops in Ruby with code samples:

Basic while Loop:

The basic while loop executes a block of code as long as the specified condition is true.
Example:

i = 0

while i < 5 do
  puts i
  i += 1
end


Output:

0
1
2
3
4





while Loop with Multiple Conditions:

You can have multiple conditions in the while loop by using logical operators (&&, ||).
Example:

i = 0
j = 10

while i < 5 && j > 0 do
  puts "i: #{i}, j: #{j}"
  i += 1
  j -= 1
end



Output:

i: 0, j: 10
i: 1, j: 9
i: 2, j: 8
i: 3, j: 7
i: 4, j: 6
    
    
    
    
while Loop with Break:

You can use the break statement to exit the loop prematurely based on a certain condition.
Example:

i = 0

while true do
  puts i
  i += 1
  break if i == 5
end


Output:

0
1
2
3
4





while Loop with Next:

The next statement is used to skip the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop.
Example:

i = 0

while i < 5 do
  i += 1
  next if i == 3
  puts i
end
Output:

1
2
4
5

while loops are useful when you want to repeat a block of code as long as a certain condition is true. 
You can use a single condition or combine multiple conditions using logical operators. 
The break and next statements provide control over the loops execution. 
Its important to ensure that the condition eventually becomes false to prevent an infinite loop.

In Ruby, a while loop is used to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a specified condition remains true. 
The syntax for a while loop in Ruby is as follows:

while condition
  # code to execute
end
Heres an example of a while loop in Ruby:

count = 0

while count < 5
  puts "Hello, world! This is loop number #{count + 1}"
  count += 1
end
In this example, the output will be:

Hello, world! This is loop number 1
Hello, world! This is loop number 2
Hello, world! This is loop number 3
Hello, world! This is loop number 4
Hello, world! This is loop number 5
The loop will continue to execute until the value of count is not less than 5.

You can also use a do-while loop in Ruby, which is similar to a while loop but guarantees that the
loop body will be executed at least once before checking the condition:

count = 0

do
  puts "Hello, world! This is loop number #{count + 1}"
  count += 1
end while count < 5
In this example, the output will be the same as in the previous example.
