In Ruby, identifiers are names used to represent various entities such as variables, constants, methods,
classes, and modules. Identifiers are used to uniquely identify these entities within the program.
Here are some rules and conventions for identifiers in Ruby:

Naming Conventions:

Variables and methods: Use lowercase letters and separate words with underscores (snake_case).
  Examples: my_variable, calculate_total.
Constants: Use uppercase letters and separate words with underscores (SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE). Examples: PI, MAX_VALUE.
Classes and modules: Use CamelCase (capitalize the first letter of each word). Examples: Person, MyModule.
Valid Characters:

Identifiers can include letters (a-z, A-Z), digits (0-9), and underscores (_).
The first character cannot be a digit.
Ruby supports Unicode characters, allowing identifiers to include non-ASCII characters.
Reserved Keywords:

Ruby has a set of reserved keywords that cannot be used as identifiers as they have special meanings in the language. 
Examples: class, def, if, while, etc.
Scope:

Identifiers are scoped based on where they are defined.
Local variables have a limited scope within the block or method they are defined in.
Instance variables (@variable) are specific to an instance of a class.
Class variables (@@variable) are shared among all instances of a class.
Global variables ($variable) have global scope and can be accessed from anywhere in the program.
Here are some examples of identifiers in Ruby:


# Variables
name = "John"
age = 30

# Constants
PI = 3.14
MAX_VALUE = 100

# Methods
def calculate_total(price, quantity)
  price * quantity
end

# Classes and modules
class Person
  attr_accessor :name

  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end
end

module MyModule
  MY_CONSTANT = 42
end


In the example above, we have identifiers such as name, age, calculate_total, Person, MyModule, etc., 
representing variables, methods, classes, and modules. Following the naming 
conventions and adhering to the rules for valid characters ensures that identifiers are clear,
readable, and consistent in Ruby code.
