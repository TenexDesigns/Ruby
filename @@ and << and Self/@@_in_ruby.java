In Ruby, `@@` is used to define class variables. Class variables are shared among all instances of a class and are prefixed with `@@`. They are similar to static variables in languages like Java, but there are some important differences:

1. **Scope**:
   - Class variables are shared within the scope of the class and its subclasses.
   - They are not accessible outside of the class and its subclasses.

2. **Initialization**:
   - Class variables are initialized when they are first encountered in the class definition.

Here's an example of how `@@` is used in Ruby:

```ruby
class MyClass
  @@class_variable = 0

  def self.increment_class_variable
    @@class_variable += 1
  end

  def print_class_variable
    puts @@class_variable
  end
end

obj1 = MyClass.new
obj1.print_class_variable  # Output: 0

obj2 = MyClass.new
obj2.print_class_variable  # Output: 0

MyClass.increment_class_variable

obj1.print_class_variable  # Output: 1
obj2.print_class_variable  # Output: 1
```

In the example above, `@@class_variable` is a class variable, and it's shared among all instances of the `MyClass` class. The `increment_class_variable` method is a class method that increments the class variable's value.

Regarding the `self` keyword in Ruby, it is used to refer to the current object or instance within a class or module. It can also be used to define class methods. `self` is not equivalent to `this` in languages like Java; rather, it refers to the instance or class it is used within. Here's a brief overview of how `self` is used:

- Within an instance method, `self` refers to the instance of the class calling the method.
- Within a class method, `self` refers to the class itself.
- It can be used to call other methods or access attributes of the current instance or class.

```ruby
class MyClass
  def instance_method
    puts "This is an instance method"
  end

  def self.class_method
    puts "This is a class method"
  end
end

obj = MyClass.new
obj.instance_method  # "This is an instance method"
MyClass.class_method  # "This is a class method"
```

In summary, `@@` is used for class variables in Ruby, and `self` is used to refer to the current instance or class within the context where it is used. They are not equivalent to the `static` keyword in Java, as Ruby has a different approach to class and instance variables/methods.
