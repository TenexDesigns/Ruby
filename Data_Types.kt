In Ruby, there are several built-in data types that you can use to store and manipulate different kinds of data.
Heres an explanation of the common data types in Ruby with code samples:

1.Numbers:

Ruby supports integers and floating-point numbers.
Example:
ruby
Copy code
age = 25             # Integer
price = 9.99         # Floating-point number




2.Strings:

Strings are sequences of characters enclosed in single quotes (')  ' or double quotes (").
Example:
ruby
Copy code
name = 'John'        # Single-quoted string
message = "Hello!"   # Double-quoted string
                                                                                       
                                                                                       
                                                                                       
                                                                                       
3.Booleans:

Booleans represent the truth values true or false.
Example:
ruby
Copy code
active = true        # Boolean true
expired = false      # Boolean false
                                                                                       
                                                                                       
                                                                                       
                                                                                       
4.Arrays:

Arrays are ordered collections of objects. They can hold objects of any type.
Elements in an array are enclosed in square brackets ([]), separated by commas.
Example:
ruby
Copy code
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]       # Array of integers
names = ['John', 'Jane', 'Joe'] # Array of strings
                                                                                       
                                                                                       
                                                                                       
                                                                                       
5.Hashes:

Hashes are key-value pairs, where each key is unique.
Hashes are created using curly braces ({}) and can store any type of data as values.
Example:

person = { name: 'John', age: 25 }      # Hash with symbol keys
book = { 'title' => 'Ruby Programming', 'author' => 'Jane Smith' }  # Hash with string keys
                                                                                       
                                                                                       
                                                                                       
                                                                                       
                                                                                       
6.Symbols:

Symbols are immutable and unique identifiers represented by a colon (:) followed by a name.
They are commonly used as keys in hashes.
Example:
ruby
Copy code
status = :active     # Symbol
                                                                                       
                                                                                       
                                                                                       
                                                                                       
7.Nil:

nil represents the absence of a value.
It is often used to indicate the absence of a valid object or uninitialized variables.
Example:
ruby
Copy code
result = nil         # Nil value
                                                                                       
                                                                                       
                                                                                       
8.Regular Expressions:

Regular expressions are patterns used to match and manipulate strings.
They are created using the // syntax or the Regexp.new constructor.
Example:

pattern = /hello/    # Regular expression pattern
                                                                                       
                                                                                       
                                                                                       
These are the basic data types in Ruby. Understanding and using these data types correctly
will help you work with different kinds of data in your Ruby programs.

********************************************************************************************************************                                                                                       
                                                                                       
                                                                                       
             
    
Sure. Here are the data types in Ruby:

String: A string is a sequence of characters. Strings are enclosed in double quotes ("") or single quotes (''). For example, the following code declares a string variable named name and assigns it the value "John Doe":
Ruby
name = "John Doe"

Number: A number is a value that represents a quantity. Numbers can be integers, floats, or decimals. For example, the following code declares a number variable named age and assigns it the value 30:
Ruby
age = 30
Use code with caution. Learn more
Boolean: A boolean is a value that represents a truth value. Boolean values can be true or false. For example, the following code declares a boolean variable named is_adult and assigns it the value true:
Ruby
is_adult = true
Use code with caution. Learn more
Symbol: A symbol is a unique identifier. Symbols are enclosed in backticks (`````. For example, the following code declares a symbol variable named :name and assigns it the value name:
Ruby
name = :name


* **Array:** An array is a collection of values. Arrays are enclosed in square brackets `[]`. For example, the following code declares an array variable named `numbers` and assigns it the values `1`, `2`, and `3`:

ruby
numbers = [1, 2, 3]


* **Hash:** A hash is a collection of key-value pairs. Hashes are enclosed in curly braces `{}`. For example, the following code declares a hash variable named `person` and assigns it the key-value pairs `name => "John Doe"` and `age => 30`:

ruby
person = { name: "John Doe", age: 30 }


* **Object:** An object is a data structure that encapsulates data and behavior. Objects are created using the `new` keyword. For example, the following code creates a new object of the `Person` class:

ruby
person = Person.new


Here are some additional things to keep in mind about data types in Ruby:

* Data types are important because they allow you to store and manipulate data in a structured way.
* Ruby is a dynamically typed language, which means that the data type of a variable can change at runtime.
* You can use the `typeof` operator to check the data type of a variable.
* You can use the `class` method to get the class of an object.
