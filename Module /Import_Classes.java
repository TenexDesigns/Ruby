Modules in Ruby are a way to group together related methods, constants, and classes. They can be used to namespace your code, share functionality between classes, and mixin behavior into existing classes.

To define a module in Ruby, you use the `module` keyword followed by the name of the module. The module name must begin with a capital letter.

```ruby
module MyModule
end
```

You can then add methods and constants to the module.

```ruby
module MyModule
  def my_method
    puts "Hello, world!"
  end

  MY_CONSTANT = 10
end
```

To access a module method or constant, you use the module name followed by a dot and the method or constant name.

```ruby
MyModule.my_method
# => "Hello, world!"

puts MyModule::MY_CONSTANT
# => 10
```

You can also include a module into a class. This will make all of the module's methods and constants available to the class.

```ruby
class MyClass
  include MyModule
end

my_object = MyClass.new

my_object.my_method
# => "Hello, world!"
```

Modules are a powerful tool for organizing and structuring your code. They can help you to avoid name clashes, share functionality between classes, and mixin behavior into existing classes.

Here are some examples of how to use modules in Ruby:

* **Namespace your code:** You can use modules to namespace your code, which can help to avoid name clashes. For example, you could create a module for all of your database-related code, and another module for all of your authentication-related code.
* **Share functionality between classes:** You can use modules to share functionality between classes. For example, you could create a module that contains all of your logging functionality, and then include that module into any class that needs to logging.
* **Mixin behavior into existing classes:** You can use modules to mixin behavior into existing classes. For example, you could create a module that contains all of your validation functionality, and then include that module into any class that needs to be validated.

Modules are a versatile tool that can be used in a variety of ways. By using modules, you can write more organized, reusable, and maintainable code.
