Certainly! In Ruby, comments are used to add explanatory notes or remarks within the code that are ignored by the interpreter.
Heres an explanation of comments in Ruby with code samples:
  
  
  

Single-Line Comments:

Single-line comments start with the # symbol and extend until the end of the line.
Example:

# This is a single-line comment.
puts "Hello, World!" # This line prints a greeting.




Multi-Line Comments:

Multi-line comments are typically used for longer comments or comment blocks. 
They begin with =begin and end with =end delimiters.
Example:

=begin
This is a
multi-line comment.
It can span multiple lines.
=end




Inline Comments:

Inline comments are used to provide clarifications on the same line of code.
They are often placed after the code.
Example:

x = 5  # Assigning the value 5 to variable x.
Comments are helpful for documenting your code, making notes, or temporarily disabling code blocks. 
They improve code readability and can assist other developers in understanding your intentions.

Its good practice to use comments sparingly and provide meaningful explanations.
Keep in mind that comments should be kept up-to-date with the code and should not state the obvious.
Well-commented code can facilitate collaboration and maintenance of the codebase.
