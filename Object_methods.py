In Ruby, object methods are defined within a class and allow objects of that class to perform specific actions or behaviors. 
Object methods are associated with individual objects and can access and manipulate the objects 
state (instance variables). Heres an explanation of object methods in Ruby with code samples:

  
  
  
  
Defining Object Methods:

Object methods are defined within the class definition using the def keyword.
Example:

class Person
  def greet
    puts "Hello, I am a person!"
  end

  def say_name(name)
    puts "My name is #{name}."
  end
end





Invoking Object Methods:

Object methods are invoked on instances of the class using dot notation (.) followed by the method 
name and any required arguments.
Example:

person = Person.new
person.greet
person.say_name("John")






Accessing Instance Variables:

Object methods have access to instance variables, allowing them to read or modify the state of the object.
Example:

class Person
  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end

  def introduce
    puts "Hello, my name is #{@name}."
  end
end

person = Person.new("John")
person.introduce




Returning Values from Object Methods:

Object methods can return values using the return keyword. 
If no explicit return statement is used, the last evaluated expression is returned.
Example:

class Calculator
  def add(a, b)
    return a + b
  end

  def multiply(a, b)
    a * b  # Implicit return
  end
end

calculator = Calculator.new
sum = calculator.add(5, 3)
product = calculator.multiply(4, 2)
Object methods encapsulate behaviors specific to objects and allow them to interact 
with other objects or manipulate their own state. They play a crucial role in object-oriented programming,
promoting modularity, code reuse, and clear organization.

Object methods in Ruby are methods that are defined within a class but are not directly 
associated with an object. Instead, they are associated with the class itself.
These methods can be used to perform operations on the class or to maintain state information for the class geeksforgeeks.org.

Heres an example using a Person class with a class method:

class Person
  def initialize(name, age, sex)
    @name = name
    @age = age
    @sex = sex
  end

  def display_person
    puts "The name of the person is #{@name} and age is #{@age} also he is a #{@sex}"
  end

  def self.greater_than(other_person, attribute)
    @age > other_person.instance_variable_get(:@age)
  end
end

person1 = Person.new("John", 30, "male")
person2 = Person.new("Jane", 25, "female")

puts person1.greater_than(person2, :age) # => true
In this example, we define a class method greater_than within the Person class. 
This method compares the age of self (the calling object) with the age of the other_person object
passed as an argument. The instance_variable_get method is used to access the @age instance variable of
the other_person object stackoverflow.com.

Sure, object methods in Ruby are functions that are defined within a class and can be called on objects of that class. They are used to perform actions on the object, such as changing its state or returning information about it.

Here is an example of an object method:

Ruby
class Person
  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end

  def say_hello
    puts "Hello, #{name}"
  end
end
Use code with caution. Learn more
In this example, the say_hello method is defined within the Person class. 
It takes no arguments and returns nothing. When an object of the Person class is created,
the say_hello method can be called on it. For example:

Ruby
person = Person.new("John Doe")
person.say_hello # => Hello, John Doe
Use code with caution. Learn more
The say_hello method is an example of an instance method.
Instance methods are methods that are defined within a class and can only be called on objects of that class.

There are also class methods, which are methods that are defined within a class and can be called on 
the class itself. Class methods are prefixed with the self keyword. For example:

Ruby
class Person
  def self.all
    # This method returns an array of all Person objects
  end
end

Person.all # => [Person(name: "John Doe"), Person(name: "Jane Doe")]
Use code with caution. Learn more
Object methods are a powerful way to add functionality to your classes.
They can be used to perform actions on objects, change their state, or return information about them.

Here are some additional things to note about object methods:

Object methods are defined within a class.
Object methods can take arguments and return values.
Object methods can be called on objects of the class they are defined in.
Object methods can be called on the class itself.
I hope this helps!
