In Ruby, the initialize method is a special method that gets called automatically when an object
is created from a class. It is used to initialize the objects state or set up any required data.
The initialize method is commonly used to assign initial values to instance variables.
Heres an explanation of the initialize method in Ruby classes:

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
Defining the initialize Method:

To define the initialize method, you include it within the class definition.
Example:

class Person
  def initialize(name, age)
    @name = name
    @age = age
  end
end









Parameters in the initialize Method:

The initialize method can accept parameters that are used to initialize the objects attributes or instance variables.
Example:

class Person
  def initialize(name, age)
    @name = name
    @age = age
  end
end

person = Person.new("John", 25)











Setting Instance Variables:

Inside the initialize method, you can set the initial values of instance variables using the passed arguments
or any other desired logic.
Example:

class Person
  def initialize(name, age)
    @name = name.capitalize
    @age = age
  end
end

person = Person.new("john", 25)
puts person.instance_variables  # [:@name, :@age]
The initialize method allows you to perform any necessary setup or initialization when creating objects from a class. 
Its where you define the initial state of the object by assigning values to instance variables. By using the initialize method, 
you can ensure that objects are properly initialized with the required data when they are created.






CODE SAMPLES
***************************************************************************************************************************************

The initialize method in Ruby is a special method that acts as a constructor for a class. 
When you create a new object, Ruby looks for an initialize method within the class and executes it. 
This method is typically used to set default values for instance variables,
which can then be used by other methods within the class ruby-doc.org.

Heres an example using the Box class from the previous answer:

class Box
  def initialize(color)
    @color = color
  end

  def display_color
    puts "The box is #{@color}."
  end
end

box1 = Box.new("red")
box2 = Box.new("blue")
box1.display_color
box2.display_color

In this example, we define an initialize method within the Box class,
which takes a color parameter. When a new Box object is created,
the initialize method is executed, and the @color instance variable is set to the provided color.
The display_color method then displays the color of the box educba.com.
