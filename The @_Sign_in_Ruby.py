The @sign is like the (this)  method in java script. 
The @ sign is used to create properites for the class method


This class now has  proeprties @name and @age, Whos value is received whe we incancetae an aobject of the Person class like here below
e.g person1 =Person("George",34)




class Person

  def initialize(nameReceived, ageReceived)
    @name = nameReceived
    @age = ageReceived
  end

  def greet
    "Hello, my name is #{@name} and I am #{@age} years old."
  end
end

In Ruby, the @ symbol is used to denote instance variables within a class. Instance variables are variables that are accessible
throughout the class and can hold different values for each instance of the class.

Here are a few key points about instance variables in Ruby:

Scope: Instance variables are accessible within the instance methods of a class.
  They are prefixed with @ followed by the variable name, such as @name, @age, etc.

Object-Specific: Each instance of a class has its own set of instance variables.
  These variables hold unique values for each instance of the class.

Access Control: Instance variables are not accessible outside the instance methods of
  a class unless explicit getter and setter methods are defined.

Lifetime: The lifetime of an instance variable is tied to the lifetime of the object it belongs to.
  When the object is garbage collected, the instance variables associated with it are also destroyed.

Heres an example that demonstrates the usage of instance variables in Ruby:

ruby
Copy code
class Person
  def initialize(name, age)
    @name = name
    @age = age
  end

  def introduce
    puts "Hi, my name is #{@name} and I am #{@age} years old."
  end
end

person1 = Person.new("John", 25)
person1.introduce

person2 = Person.new("Alice", 30)
person2.introduce
In the example above, @name and @age are instance variables that hold different values for each
instance of the Person class. The introduce method uses these instance variables to display the person's name and age.

The @ symbol is a convention in Ruby to denote instance variables and differentiate
them from local variables within a method or block. It allows you to store and access data specific to each instance of a class.

In Ruby, the at-sign (@) before a variable name (e.g., @variable_name) is used to create a class instance variable designcise.com.
Class instance variables are only directly accessible within the class instance methods of the class theyre defined in.
They are used to store data that is specific to an instance of a class, as opposed to class variables, 
which are shared among all instances of a class.

Heres an example to illustrate the use of class instance variables:

class Person
  attr_accessor :name, :age

  def initialize(name, age)
    @name = name
    @age = age
  end

  def greet
    "Hello, my name is #{@name} and I am #{@age} years old."
  end
end

person = Person.new("John Doe", 30)
puts person.greet # Output: Hello, my name is John Doe and I am 30 years old.
In this example, the @name and @age instance variables store the name and age of a person, respectively.
These variables are accessible within the Person class methods, such as the greet method.

In summary, the at-sign (@) in Ruby is used to create class instance variables, which store data specific 
to an instance of a class and are only directly accessible within the class instance methods.

The @ symbol in Ruby is used to declare instance variables.
Instance variables are variables that are specific to an object. 
They are not shared between objects. To declare an instance variable, you use the @ symbol followed by the variable name.
For example:

Code snippet
class Person
  @name = "John Doe"
  @age = 30
end

person = Person.new

puts person.name # => "John Doe"
puts person.age # => 30
Use code with caution. Learn more
In this example, the @name and @age variables are instance variables of the Person class.
The person object can access these variables, but other objects cannot.

The @ symbol can also be used to access instance variables from within a class. For example:

Code snippet
class Person
  def initialize(name, age)
    @name = name
    @age = age
  end

  def say_hello
    puts "Hello, my name is #{@name}"
  end
end

person = Person.new("John Doe", 30)

person.say_hello # => "Hello, my name is John Doe"
Use code with caution. Learn more
In this example, the say_hello method uses the @name instance variable to print the person's name.

The @ symbol is a powerful tool that can be used to declare and access instance variables in Ruby.
