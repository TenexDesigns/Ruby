The text you provided is explaining a convention for referencing methods in Ruby and Rails, particularly when reading and writing documentation or discussing code. Its a convention used to clarify whether a method operates on an instance of a class or on the class itself. Let's break it down:

1. Method Invocation with a Dot (`.`):
   When you call methods on an instance of a class, you use the dot (`.`) operator to invoke the method. For example, if you have an instance of the `Article` class called `article`, you might call `article.errors` to get the errors collection specific to that `article` instance.

2. Method Reference with a Hash (`#`):
   When you reference a method in Ruby documentation or when discussing code, the convention is to use the hash (`#`) symbol followed by the method name to indicate that the method is associated with instances of the class. For example, `Article#title` would be used to refer to a method that gets or sets the title of an instance of the `Article` class.

3. Class Method Reference without an Instance:
   If a method can be called directly on the class itself (a class method) without requiring an instance, you would refer to it using the class name. For example, `Article.count` would indicate a class method that retrieves the count of all `Article` objects without referencing a specific instance.

Here's a summary of the convention:

- `instance.method` (with a dot): Refers to a method called on a specific instance of a class.
- `Class#method`: Refers to a method associated with instances of the class.
- `Class.method`: Refers to a class method called on the class itself without referencing a specific instance.

This convention is helpful in documentation and discussions to clarify whether a method is intended to operate on a specific instance of a class or if its a class method that doesn't require an instance. It provides context to readers and helps them understand the purpose and usage of methods in code.
