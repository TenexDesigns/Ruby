In Ruby, both single quotes ('') and double quotes ("") are used to define string literals. 
However, they have some differences in terms of their behavior and usage. 
Heres an explanation of when to use each type of string literal:

Single quotes (''):

Literal Values: Single quotes preserve the literal value of characters within the string. 
  They treat most escape sequences (e.g., \n, \t) as literal characters rather than interpreting them.
Faster Performance: Single-quoted strings are generally faster to process because Ruby does not perform any interpolation
  or escape sequence interpretation on them.
Limited Interpolation: Variables or expressions within single quotes are not evaluated or interpolated.
  They are treated as literal text.
Use Cases: Single quotes are commonly used when you need to represent literal values, 
  want faster string processing, or want to avoid interpolation or escape sequence interpretation.
Example:


name = 'John'
puts 'Hello, #{name}!'  # Output: Hello, #{name}!
Double quotes (""):

Interpolation: Double quotes allow for string interpolation, meaning variables and expressions within the 
  string are evaluated and interpolated.
Escape Sequences: Double quotes interpret escape sequences like \n (newline) and \t (tab), replacing them with
  their corresponding characters.
Use Cases: Double quotes are commonly used when you need string interpolation, want to include escape sequences,
  or need the flexibility to embed variable values or expressions within the string.
Example:


name = 'John'
puts "Hello, #{name}!"  # Output: Hello, John!
Its important to note that using single quotes or double quotes also depends on personal preference, coding style guidelines,
and the specific requirements of your code. In general, if you need interpolation or escape sequence interpretation, 
you should use double quotes. 
If you want to preserve the literal value of characters or prefer faster string processing, you can use single quotes.
