String interpolation in Ruby allows you to embed expressions or values within a string. 
It is a way to dynamically insert the value of variables,
method results, or expressions into a string.
Heres an explanation of string interpolation in Ruby with code samples:


  
Embedding Variables:

You can directly embed the value of variables within a string using the #{} syntax.
Example:

name = "John"
puts "Hello, #{name}!"    # Output: Hello, John!




String interpolation in Ruby allows you to embed expressions or variables within a string,
which are automatically converted into string format and replaced by their evaluated values when the string is executed. 
You can use string interpolation by enclosing the expressions or variables in curly braces ({}) within double quotes ("").

Heres an example of string interpolation in Ruby:

a = 1
b = 4
puts "The number #{a} is less than #{b}"
This code will output: The number 1 is less than 4.

In this example, the variables a and b are embedded within the string using string interpolation. 
Ruby automatically converts the values of a and b to strings and replaces the expressions with their evaluated values geeksforgeeks.org.

Another example:

s = 'Groot'
n = 16
puts "#{s} age=#{n}"
This code will output: Groot age=16.

In this example, the variables s and n are embedded within the string using string interpolation.
Ruby automatically converts the values of s and n to strings and replaces the 
expressions with their evaluated values geeksforgeeks.org.

String interpolation is preferred over string concatenation because it doesn require additional 
conversions of data types to strings, and its more readable and efficient

String interpolation in Ruby allows you to embed expressions or values within a string.
It is a way to dynamically insert the value of variables, method results, or expressions into a string.
Heres an explanation of string interpolation in Ruby with code samples:

Using Double Quotes:

String interpolation is done using double-quoted strings (" ").
Example:

name = "John"
age = 25
puts "My name is #{name} and I am #{age} years old."




Embedding Variables:

You can directly embed the value of variables within a string using the #{} syntax.
Example:

name = "John"
puts "Hello, #{name}!"    # Output: Hello, John!





Evaluating Expressions:

String interpolation can also include expressions, allowing you to perform calculations or manipulate data within the string.
Example:
ruby
Copy code
num1 = 10
num2 = 5
puts "The sum of #{num1} and #{num2} is #{num1 + num2}."



Invoking Methods:

String interpolation can include the result of method invocations.
Example:
ruby
Copy code
def greet(name)
  "Hello, #{name}!"
end

puts greet("John")   # Output: Hello, John!
String interpolation provides a convenient way to construct strings with dynamic content in Ruby. 
It simplifies the process of combining string literals with variable values, expressions, or method results.
By using string interpolation, you can create more readable and concise code when working with strings that involve dynamic content.
