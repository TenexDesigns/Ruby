In Rails (which is built on top of Ruby), the do...end block is an alternative syntax to define a block of code.
It is often used with various methods and iterators in Rails to encapsulate a set of instructions or logic. 
Heres how the do...end block is used in Rails:

Syntax:


method_name do |parameter(s)|
  # Block of code
end
Explanation:

method_name: The method that accepts a block of code.
parameter(s): Optional parameter(s) that can be passed to the block.
Block of code: The instructions or logic to be executed within the block.
Example 1 - Iteration with each:


names = ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie']

names.each do |name|
  puts "Hello, #{name}!"
end

In the above example, the each method iterates over the names array.
The block of code defined using do...end is executed for each element in the array, and it prints a greeting for each name.

Example 2 - Method definition:


def multiply(a, b)
  result = a * b
  yield(result)
end

multiply(2, 3) do |product|
  puts "The product is: #{product}"
end

In this example, the multiply method takes two parameters a and b and calculates their product.
The yield statement within the method invokes the block of code provided when calling the method. 
The block receives the calculated product as a parameter and prints it.

The do...end block is a flexible and commonly used syntax in Rails and Ruby for defining blocks of code.
It allows you to encapsulate logic and pass it as an argument to methods or iterators,
enabling you to write clean and expressive code.












MORE EXPLANATION
*****************************************************************************************************************






In Ruby, a block is an anonymous piece of code that can be passed as an argument to a method.
Blocks can be defined using either do...end or curly braces {...}.
The do...end syntax is typically used for multiline blocks, while the curly braces are used for single-line blocks. This convention is popularized by Ruby on Rails and widely followed in the Ruby community.

Heres an example of using do...end and curly braces for blocks:

# Using do...end for a multiline block
[1, 2, 3].each do |number|
  square = number * number
  puts "The square of #{number} is #{square}"
end

# Using curly braces for a single-line block
[1, 2, 3].each { |number| puts "The number is #{number}" }
In both examples, we are passing a block to the each method of an array. 
The first example uses the do...end syntax for a multiline block,
while the second example uses the curly braces syntax for a single-line block.

Its important to note that there is a difference in precedence between do...end and {...}. 
Curly-brace blocks have a higher precedence than do...end blocks. T
his can lead to different behavior in some cases, 
but its generally not an issue when following the single-line and multiline convention.
