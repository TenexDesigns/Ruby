Mixins in Ruby refer to the ability to include (mix in) the methods and behaviors defined in one module into another class. This allows you to compose classes with multiple modules, providing a way to share and reuse code without traditional inheritance.

Here's a closer look at mixin composition and how it's used in Ruby:

1. **Mixin Composition**:
   - Mixin composition is the process of including multiple modules into a class to extend its functionality.
   - If a class includes multiple modules and there are method name conflicts (i.e., two or more modules define methods with the same name), the method from the last included module takes precedence. This behavior is sometimes called "last in, first out" (LIFO).

   ```ruby
   module ModuleA
     def shared_method
       puts "This is from ModuleA"
     end
   end

   module ModuleB
     def shared_method
       puts "This is from ModuleB"
     end
   end

   class MyClass
     include ModuleA
     include ModuleB
   end

   obj = MyClass.new
   obj.shared_method
   # Output: "This is from ModuleB"
   ```

   In this example, `MyClass` includes both `ModuleA` and `ModuleB`. When calling `shared_method` on an instance of `MyClass`, the method from `ModuleB` takes precedence.

2. **Mixin Behavior into Existing Classes**:
   - Mixins are a way to add behavior to existing classes, which can be especially useful when you can't or don't want to modify the original class directly.
   - For example, you could create a module containing validation methods and include that module into any class that needs validation functionality.

   ```ruby
   module Validation
     def validate_email(email)
       # Validation logic for email
     end
   end

   class User
     include Validation
     attr_accessor :email

     def initialize(email)
       @email = email
     end
   end

   user = User.new("example@example.com")
   user.validate_email(user.email)
   ```

   In this case, the `User` class includes the `Validation` module to add email validation functionality without modifying the `User` class directly.

Mixins are a powerful feature in Ruby and contribute to the language's flexibility and code reusability. They allow you to create modular, reusable code and enhance existing classes without the need for deep inheritance hierarchies.
