Ruby and Rails support various object-oriented design patterns, and you can implement these patterns to write clean and maintainable code. Below are some common object-oriented design patterns and code samples demonstrating their usage in Ruby and Rails.

1. **Singleton Pattern:**
   Ensure that a class has only one instance and provides a global point to that instance.

   ```ruby
   require 'singleton'

   class SingletonClass
     include Singleton

     def some_method
       puts "Singleton method called"
     end
   end

   instance1 = SingletonClass.instance
   instance2 = SingletonClass.instance

   puts instance1 == instance2 # true
   ```

2. **Factory Pattern:**
   Create objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created.

   ```ruby
   class AnimalFactory
     def create_animal(type)
       case type
       when :dog
         Dog.new
       when :cat
         Cat.new
       else
         raise "Invalid animal type"
       end
     end
   end

   class Dog
     def speak
       "Woof!"
     end
   end

   class Cat
     def speak
       "Meow!"
     end
   end

   factory = AnimalFactory.new
   animal = factory.create_animal(:dog)
   puts animal.speak # "Woof!"
   ```

3. **Decorator Pattern:**
   Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically.

   ```ruby
   class Coffee
     def cost
       5
     end
   end

   class MilkDecorator
     def initialize(coffee)
       @coffee = coffee
     end

     def cost
       @coffee.cost + 2
     end
   end

   coffee = Coffee.new
   coffee_with_milk = MilkDecorator.new(coffee)
   puts coffee_with_milk.cost # 7
   ```

4. **Observer Pattern:**
   Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

   In Rails, you can use the built-in `ActiveSupport::Notifications` for implementing the Observer pattern.

   ```ruby
   require 'active_support/notifications'

   class Publisher
     def publish_event(event_name, data)
       ActiveSupport::Notifications.publish(event_name, self, data)
     end
   end

   class Subscriber
     def initialize
       ActiveSupport::Notifications.subscribe('custom.event') do |_, _, data|
         handle_event(data)
       end
     end

     def handle_event(data)
       puts "Received event with data: #{data}"
     end
   end

   publisher = Publisher.new
   subscriber = Subscriber.new
   publisher.publish_event('custom.event', { message: 'Hello, world!' })
   ```

5. **Command Pattern:**
   Encapsulate a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with requests, queuing of requests, and logging of requests.

   In Rails, this pattern is commonly used when implementing background job processing with libraries like Sidekiq or Resque. Each job is a command to be executed asynchronously.

   ```ruby
   class CreateInvoiceJob
     include Sidekiq::Worker

     def perform(order_id)
       order = Order.find(order_id)
       # Create and send an invoice
     end
   end

   # Enqueue the job
   CreateInvoiceJob.perform_async(order.id)
   ```

These are just a few examples of how object-oriented design patterns can be applied in Ruby and Rails. Depending on your application's requirements, you may find other design patterns suitable and use them accordingly.

  In the provided code for the Singleton Pattern, the instance method `instance` is called on the `SingletonClass` class. This method is provided by including the `Singleton` module, which is imported using `require 'singleton'`.

Here's what each part of the code does:

1. `require 'singleton'`: This line imports the `Singleton` module, which provides the necessary methods for creating a singleton class.

2. `class SingletonClass`: This defines a new class named `SingletonClass`.

3. `include Singleton`: By including the `Singleton` module in `SingletonClass`, you make it a singleton class. This means that the class can have only one instance throughout the application's lifetime.

4. `def some_method`: This defines an instance method named `some_method` for the `SingletonClass` class.

5. `puts "Singleton method called"`: This line of code is the implementation of the `some_method` instance method, which simply prints the message "Singleton method called" to the console.

6. `instance1 = SingletonClass.instance`: This line calls the `instance` method on the `SingletonClass` class, which is provided by the `Singleton` module. It returns the single instance of `SingletonClass`.

7. `instance2 = SingletonClass.instance`: Similarly, this line calls the `instance` method to obtain the same instance as `instance1`. Since it's a singleton class, there can be only one instance.

8. `puts instance1 == instance2`: This line compares `instance1` and `instance2`. Since they both refer to the same instance (due to the singleton nature), the comparison returns `true`.

So, the code ensures that you can create only one instance of the `SingletonClass`, and any attempt to create more instances will return the same instance. The `Singleton` module provides this behavior by restricting the class to a single instance.
