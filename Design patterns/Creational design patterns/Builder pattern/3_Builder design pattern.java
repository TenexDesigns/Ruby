The Builder design pattern is a creational pattern that allows for the step-by-step creation of complex objects using the correct sequence of actions. The construction is controlled by a director object that only needs to know the type of object it is to create.

In Ruby and Rails, the Builder pattern can be used to simplify the creation of complex objects, especially when there are many ways to instantiate an object or when the object creation involves multiple steps.

Here's an example of how you can use the Builder pattern in Ruby:

```ruby
class CarBuilder
  attr_accessor :car

  def initialize
    @car = Car.new
  end

  def set_model(model)
    @car.model = model
  end

  def set_engine(engine)
    @car.engine = engine
  end

  def set_color(color)
    @car.color = color
  end

  def build
    @car
  end
end

class Car
  attr_accessor :model, :engine, :color

  def initialize
    @model = nil
    @engine = nil
    @color = nil
  end
end

# Usage
builder = CarBuilder.new
builder.set_model('Model S')
builder.set_engine('Electric')
builder.set_color('Red')
car = builder.build
```

In this example, the `CarBuilder` class is used to gradually construct a `Car` object. The `CarBuilder` provides methods to set the model, engine, and color of the car. The `build` method is used to return the final `Car` object.

This pattern is particularly useful in Rails when you have complex forms that need to create or update multiple models. By using a builder, you can encapsulate the logic of creating or updating these models in a separate class, making your controllers and models cleaner and easier to maintain.
