The Builder pattern is a creational design pattern that separates the construction of complex objects from their representation. It allows you to create an object step by step, customizing its type and content while hiding the construction details. The Builder pattern is particularly useful when you need to create complex objects with many possible configurations.

In Ruby and Rails, you can use the Builder pattern to create complex objects in a modular and flexible way. Here's an example of the Builder pattern in Ruby:

```ruby
# Product represents the complex object to be constructed.
class Product
  attr_accessor :part1, :part2, :part3

  def initialize
    @part1 = nil
    @part2 = nil
    @part3 = nil
  end

  def describe
    "Part 1: #{@part1}, Part 2: #{@part2}, Part 3: #{@part3}"
  end
end

# Builder is an abstract interface for creating parts of the product.
class Builder
  def build_part1
    raise NotImplementedError, "#{self.class} has not implemented method 'build_part1'"
  end

  def build_part2
    raise NotImplementedError, "#{self.class} has not implemented method 'build_part2'"
  end

  def build_part3
    raise NotImplementedError, "#{self.class} has not implemented method 'build_part3'"
  end
end

# ConcreteBuilder is a specific implementation of the Builder interface.
class ConcreteBuilder < Builder
  def initialize
    @product = Product.new
  end

  def build_part1
    @product.part1 = "Part 1 built"
  end

  def build_part2
    @product.part2 = "Part 2 built"
  end

  def build_part3
    @product.part3 = "Part 3 built"
  end

  def product
    @product
  end
end

# Director constructs an object using the Builder interface.
class Director
  def construct(builder)
    builder.build_part1
    builder.build_part2
    builder.build_part3
  end
end

# Client code
builder = ConcreteBuilder.new
director = Director.new

director.construct(builder)
product = builder.product

puts product.describe
```

In this example, the Builder pattern is used to create a `Product` object with multiple parts (part1, part2, and part3). The `ConcreteBuilder` class provides a specific implementation of the `Builder` interface. The `Director` class orchestrates the construction process, and the client code demonstrates how to use the pattern to create a customized `Product`.

You can adapt this pattern to different scenarios in your Ruby or Rails applications where you need to create complex objects with various configurations. The Builder pattern promotes modularity and flexibility in object construction, making your code more maintainable and understandable.
