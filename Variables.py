In Ruby, variables are used to store and manipulate data. Here's an explanation of Ruby variables with code samples:

Local Variables:

Local variables are declared using lowercase letters or underscores and are scoped to the current block or method.
They are used to store data within a specific scope.
Example:
ruby
Copy code
name = "John"  # Assigning a string value to the local variable 'name'
age = 25       # Assigning an integer value to the local variable 'age'
Instance Variables:

Instance variables begin with the @ symbol and are available within an instance of a class.
They hold state or data specific to each instance of the class.
Example:
ruby
Copy code
class Person
  def initialize(name)
    @name = name   # Assigning the 'name' parameter to the instance variable '@name'
  end
end

person = Person.new("John")
Class Variables:

Class variables begin with the @@ symbol and are shared among all instances of a class.
They hold data that is shared across instances of a class.
Example:
ruby
Copy code
class Person
  @@count = 0       # Initializing the class variable '@@count' with 0
  
  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
    @@count += 1     # Incrementing the class variable '@@count' by 1
  end
  
  def self.count     # Class method to access the class variable '@@count'
    @@count
  end
end

person1 = Person.new("John")
person2 = Person.new("Jane")

puts Person.count    # Output: 2
Global Variables:

Global variables start with the $ symbol and are accessible throughout the entire Ruby program.
They should be used sparingly, as they can lead to naming conflicts and make code harder to maintain.
Example:
ruby
Copy code
$global_var = "Hello"   # Assigning the string value "Hello" to the global variable '$global_var'

def some_method
  puts $global_var      # Accessing the global variable '$global_var'
end

some_method             # Output: Hello
Constants:

Constants begin with an uppercase letter and are used to store values that should not be changed.
They are accessible throughout the program but should be defined within classes or modules.
Example:
ruby
Copy code
PI = 3.14159      # Defining a constant 'PI' with the value 3.14159

class Circle
  def calculate_area(radius)
    2 * PI * radius
  end
end

circle = Circle.new
puts circle.calculate_area(5)    # Output: 31.4159
These are the different types of variables in Ruby, each with its own scope and purpose.
Understanding and using variables correctly is essential for effective programming in Ruby.

In Ruby, variables are used to store data values. Variable names in Ruby can be created from alphanumeric characters and the underscore (_) character. A variable cannot begin with a number, and variable names cannot begin with a capital letter zetcode.com.

Here's an example of variable naming conventions in Ruby:

#!/usr/bin/ruby
i = 5
p i
I = 7
p I
In this example, two variables i and I are defined, holding different values. The code output will be:

5
7
Global variables in Ruby are accessible from anywhere in the Ruby program, regardless of where they are declared. Global variable names are prefixed with a dollar sign ($) techotopia.com.

For example:

$welcome = "Welcome to Ruby Essentials"
However, the use of global variables is strongly discouraged due to their visibility and potential for unintended changes throughout the application.

In object-oriented programming, classes are templates for creating objects. Classes in Ruby can contain class variables, instance variables, and methods. Instance variables in Ruby are created for each class instance and are accessible only within that instance. Variables beginning with the @ character are 'instance variables' w3resource.com.

Here's an example of a Ruby class with instance variables:

class Calculation
  @x = 100

  def add_num
    @x = 200
  end

  def show_data
    puts 'Value of x is : ', @x
  end
end

instance = Calculation.new
instance.show_data
instance.add_num
instance.show_data
In this example, the Calculation class has an instance variable @x, which is accessible only within the class instance. The instance methods add_num and show_data are used to modify and display the value of @x. The code output will be:

Value of x is : 100
Value of x is : 200
