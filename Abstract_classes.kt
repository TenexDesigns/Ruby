In Ruby, abstract classes are not explicitly defined as such.
However, you can achieve similar behavior by using conventions and raising errors when attempting to directly 
instantiate the class. Heres an example of how you can create an abstract class in Ruby:


class AbstractClass
  def initialize
    raise NotImplementedError, "#{self.class} is an abstract class and cannot be instantiated directly."
  end

  def some_method
    raise NotImplementedError, "Subclasses must implement this method."
  end
end

class ConcreteClass < AbstractClass
  def initialize
    
    # Additional initialization for ConcreteClass
  end

  def some_method
    puts "Implementation of some_method in ConcreteClass"
  end
end

In this example, AbstractClass defines a constructor that raises a NotImplementedError 
if an attempt is made to directly instantiate the class. It also defines a method some_method that raises a NotImplementedError,
indicating that subclasses must provide an implementation.

The ConcreteClass inherits from AbstractClass and provides concrete implementations for both the constructor and some_method.

Lets see how these classes behave:


abstract_obj = AbstractClass.new
# Raises NotImplementedError: AbstractClass is an abstract class and cannot be instantiated directly.

concrete_obj = ConcreteClass.new
# Creates an instance of ConcreteClass

concrete_obj.some_method
# Outputs: Implementation of some_method in ConcreteClass

abstract_obj.some_method
# Raises NotImplementedError: Subclasses must implement this method.
As shown in the example, attempting to instantiate AbstractClass directly raises an error,
indicating that it is an abstract class. On the other hand, creating an instance of ConcreteClass works as expected.

When calling some_method, the implementation provided by ConcreteClass is executed,
while calling it on AbstractClass raises an error, indicating that subclasses must provide an implementation.

By following these conventions and raising errors for incomplete or abstract methods,
you can achieve a similar effect to abstract classes in Ruby.
