In Ruby, methods are blocks of code that perform a specific task or set of operations.
They provide a way to encapsulate reusable functionality. 
Heres an explanation of methods in Ruby, including arguments and default arguments, with code samples:

Defining a Method:

Methods are defined using the def keyword, followed by the method name, parentheses for arguments (optional), and the method body.
Example:

def say_hello
  puts "Hello, world!"
end
Calling a Method:

Once a method is defined, you can call it by using its name followed by parentheses.
Example:

say_hello   # Output: Hello, world!
Method Arguments:

Methods can accept arguments, which are values passed into the method for processing.
Arguments are defined within parentheses after the method name.
Example:

def greet(name)
  puts "Hello, #{name}!"
end

greet("John")   # Output: Hello, John!
greet("Alice")  # Output: Hello, Alice!
Default Arguments:

You can assign default values to method parameters, which will be used if no value is provided when calling the method.
Default arguments are specified using the assignment operator (=) after the parameter.
Example:

def greet(name = "world")
  puts "Hello, #{name}!"
end

greet         # Output: Hello, world!
greet("John") # Output: Hello, John!
Returning Values:

Methods can return values using the return keyword. If no return statement is used, 
the method will return the value of the last evaluated expression.
Example:

def add(a, b)
  return a + b
end

result = add(3, 4)
puts result   # Output: 7
Method Naming Conventions:

Ruby conventionally uses snake_case for method names (e.g., calculate_total, get_user_info).
Methods that end with a ? are often used to indicate that they return a boolean value.
Methods that end with a ! are used to indicate that they perform a potentially destructive or dangerous operation.
Methods provide a way to modularize code, make it reusable, and improve code organization. 
They enable you to encapsulate functionality and pass data to and from the method through arguments and return values.

In Ruby, methods are blocks of code that perform specific tasks and return a result.
They are time-saving and help users reuse code without retyping it. 
Methods are defined using the def keyword followed by the method name and end with the end keyword.
Method names should be in lowercase. Methods must be defined before calling,
and you can call a method by simply writing its name geeksforgeeks.org.

Heres a basic example of defining and calling a method:

def greet(name)
  puts "Hello, #{name}!"
end

greet("John") # Output: Hello, John!
Ruby also has a method_missing method that allows you to catch errors when a method cannot be found.
Instead of stopping the program, you can handle the situation intelligently fincher.org:

class MathWiz
  def add(a, b)
    return a + b
  end

  def method_missing(name, *args)
    puts "I do not know the method #{name}"
  end
end

mathwiz = MathWiz.new
puts mathwiz.add(1, 4) # Output: 5
puts mathwiz.subtract(4, 2) # Output: I do not know the method subtract
In addition to methods, Ruby also supports BEGIN and END blocks.
The BEGIN block is executed while the Ruby program is loading,
and the END block is executed after the interpreter has loaded the code but before execution fincher.org:

puts "main program running"
END {
  puts "program ending"
}
BEGIN {
  puts "I am loading"
}
These are some examples of methods, method_missing, BEGIN, and END blocks in Ruby.

In Ruby, methods are blocks of code that can be defined using the def keyword and are associated with
a particular object or class. Methods can have arguments, which are values passed to the method when it is called. 
You can also provide default values for method arguments, which will be used if the caller does
not provide a value for that argument medium.com.

Heres an example of a method with default arguments:

def greet(name, greeting = "Hello")
  puts "#{greeting}, #{name}!"
end
In this example, the greeting argument has a default value of "Hello".
If the caller does not provide a value for the greeting argument, the default value will be used.

greet("John") # Output: Hello, John!
greet("John", "Hi") # Output: Hi, John!
You can also provide default values for multiple arguments:

def welcome(name, greeting = "Welcome", additional_info = "to our club")
  puts "#{greeting}, #{name}. #{additional_info}"
end
If you want to use keyword arguments, you can pass a hash to the method and use the hash to access the values:

def print_info(info)
  puts info
end

print_info(age: 30, name: "John", city: "New York")
You can also use the splat operator (*) to collect all remaining keyword arguments in an array:

def print_info(age, name, *extra_info)
  puts "Age: #{age}, Name: #{name}"
  extra_info.each { |key, value| puts "#{key}: #{value}" }
end

print_info(30, "John", city: "New York", job: "Developer")
In this example, the extra_info array contains the remaining keyword arguments.
You can then iterate over the array and access the key-value pairs using the each method stackoverflow.com, yisraelg3.medium.com.

These are some examples of how to define and use methods with arguments and default values in Ruby.
