In Ruby, classes are created using the `class` keyword, and instances of those classes are typically instantiated using the `new` method. You do not create instances by directly invoking the class like `Cat = Animal()`. Here's how you create and instantiate classes in Ruby:

1. Creating a Class:
   To create a class, you use the `class` keyword followed by the class name, and then define the class's methods and attributes inside the class block.

   ```ruby
   class Animal
     def initialize(name)
       @name = name
     end

     def speak
       "I'm an animal"
     end
   end
   ```

2. Instantiating a Class:
   You create instances of the class using the `new` method, and you can provide any required arguments to the `initialize` method (if defined) when instantiating the object.

   ```ruby
   my_animal = Animal.new("Fido")
   ```

   In the example above, we create an instance of the `Animal` class and provide the name "Fido" as an argument to the `initialize` method.

3. Accessing Object Methods and Attributes:
   You can access methods and instance variables (attributes) of the object by using dot notation.

   ```ruby
   puts my_animal.speak
   puts my_animal.instance_variable_get("@name")
   ```

   This code will call the `speak` method on `my_animal` and retrieve the value of the `@name` instance variable.

So, you instantiate a class in Ruby by using the `new` method with the class name, and you don't create instances by directly invoking the class itself. The `initialize` method (the constructor) is called automatically when you create a new instance, and it can be used to set up the initial state of the object.
