Inheritance in Ruby is a fundamental object-oriented programming concept that allows one class to inherit the properties and behaviors (methods and attributes) of another class. It enables code reuse, extensibility, and the creation of class hierarchies.

Here's how inheritance works in Ruby:

1. **Superclass and Subclass**:
   - Inheritance involves two classes: a superclass (parent class) and a subclass (child class).
   - The superclass is the class from which you want to inherit properties and behaviors.
   - The subclass is the new class that inherits from the superclass.

2. **Defining a Superclass**:
   - You define a superclass by creating a class with the methods and attributes you want to share.
   - For example:

   ```ruby
   class Animal
     def speak
       puts "Animal speaks"
     end
   end
   ```

3. **Defining a Subclass**:
   - To create a subclass, use the `<` symbol followed by the name of the superclass in the class definition.
   - The subclass inherits all the methods and attributes of the superclass.

   ```ruby
   class Dog < Animal
     def bark
       puts "Woof! Woof!"
     end
   end
   ```

4. **Inheriting Methods**:
   - The subclass inherits all methods from the superclass. In this example, `Dog` inherits the `speak` method from `Animal`.
   - You can also add new methods to the subclass.

5. **Overriding Methods**:
   - Subclasses can override methods from the superclass by redefining them in the subclass.
   - This allows you to provide custom implementations for methods in the subclass.

   ```ruby
   class Dog < Animal
     def speak
       puts "Dog barks"
     end
   end
   ```

6. **Calling Superclass Methods**:
   - In overridden methods, you can call the superclass's implementation using the `super` keyword.
   - This allows you to extend the behavior of the superclass's method in the subclass.

   ```ruby
   class Dog < Animal
     def speak
       super
       puts "Dog barks"
     end
   end
   ```

7. **Using `is_a?` and `kind_of?`**:
   - You can check if an object is an instance of a particular class or its subclasses using the `is_a?` or `kind_of?` methods.

   ```ruby
   my_dog = Dog.new
   puts my_dog.is_a?(Animal) # true
   puts my_dog.is_a?(Dog)    # true
   ```

8. **Using `ancestors`**:
   - The `ancestors` method allows you to see the inheritance hierarchy of a class.
   - It returns an array of classes in the order they are checked when a method is called on an object.

   ```ruby
   puts Dog.ancestors
   # [Dog, Animal, Object, Kernel, BasicObject]
   ```

Inheritance in Ruby is a powerful way to create class hierarchies, promote code reuse, and achieve a more organized and maintainable codebase. Subclasses can add specific functionality while inheriting common behavior from the superclass.
