Classes in Ruby are blueprints for creating objects. Objects are self-contained entities with their own data and behavior. Classes allow us to define the common data and behavior of a group of related objects.

To create a class in Ruby, we use the `class` keyword followed by the name of the class. The class name must begin with a capital letter.

```ruby
class MyClass
end
```

We can then add methods and instance variables to the class. Methods are functions that define the behavior of objects. Instance variables are variables that belong to individual objects.

```ruby
class MyClass
  def my_method
    puts "Hello, world!"
  end

  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end

  def greet
    puts "Hello, #{@name}!"
  end
end
```

To create an object from a class, we use the `new` keyword.

```ruby
my_object = MyClass.new("Bard")
```

We can then call the methods on the object.

```ruby
my_object.greet
# => "Hello, Bard!"
```

Here is a more complete example of a Ruby class:

```ruby
class Person
  attr_accessor :name, :age

  def initialize(name, age)
    @name = name
    @age = age
  end

  def greet
    puts "Hello, my name is #{@name} and I am #{@age} years old."
  end
end

# Create a new Person object
person1 = Person.new("Bard", 24)

# Call the greet method on the Person object
person1.greet
# => "Hello, my name is Bard and I am 24 years old."
```

Classes are a powerful tool for organizing and structuring our code. By using classes, we can create reusable blueprints for creating objects. This can make our code more efficient and maintainable.
