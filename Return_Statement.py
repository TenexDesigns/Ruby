In Ruby, the return statement is used to explicitly return a value from a method.
It allows you to specify the value that should be returned and terminates the execution of the method.
Heres an explanation of the return statement with code samples:

Returning a Value:

You can use the return statement to return a specific value from a method.
Example:

def add(a, b)
  return a + b
end

result = add(3, 4)
puts result   # Output: 7
Early Return:

The return statement can be used to exit a method prematurely and return a value before the method's completion.
Example:

def check_number(num)
  return "Positive" if num > 0
  return "Negative" if num < 0
  return "Zero"
end

puts check_number(5)   # Output: Positive
puts check_number(-3)  # Output: Negative
puts check_number(0)   # Output: Zero
Implicit Return:

If you dont explicitly use the return statement,
Ruby will return the value of the last evaluated expression automatically.
Example:

def multiply(a, b)
  a * b   # The result of this expression is returned implicitly
end

result = multiply(4, 5)
puts result   # Output: 20
Returning Multiple Values:

Ruby methods can only return a single value. However, you can use an array or hash to return multiple values as a single object.
Example:
ruby
Copy code
def get_name_and_age
  name = "John"
  age = 25
  return [name, age]
end

result = get_name_and_age
puts result[0]   # Output: John
puts result[1]   # Output: 25
The return statement is useful when you want to explicitly specify the return value of a method or exit the method prematurely. 
It gives you control over what value is returned and when the method execution should end.

In Ruby, a method always returns exactly one object, which could be the object nil, meaning "nothing".
A method can return different objects based on the evaluation of expressions within the method.
By default, if a method does not have an explicit return statement, 
it will return the value of the last evaluated expression ruby-for-beginners.rubymonstas.org, medium.com.

Heres an example of a method returning the value of the last evaluated expression:

def add_two(number)
  number + 2
end

puts add_two(3) # Output: 5
In this example, the method add_two adds 2 to the input number and returns the result.
Since the input is 3, the method returns 5.

If you want to explicitly return a value from a method, you can use the return keyword:

def explicit_return_call
  return "return call"
end

puts explicit_return_call() # Output: return call
In this example, the method explicit_return_call returns the string "return call" when it is called.
If no value is passed as an argument to the return keyword, it returns nil medium.com.

In summary, methods in Ruby return the value of the last evaluated expression by default. 
You can also use the return keyword to explicitly return a value from a method.
