In Node.js, operators are used to perform various operations on values,
such as arithmetic, assignment, comparison, logical, and more. 
Heres an explanation of common operators in Node.js with code samples:

Arithmetic Operators:

Arithmetic operators perform mathematical calculations on numeric values.
Examples:

let x = 5;
let y = 2;
let sum = x + y;      // Addition: 7
let difference = x - y; // Subtraction: 3
let product = x * y;   // Multiplication: 10
let quotient = x / y;  // Division: 2.5
let remainder = x % y; // Modulus (Remainder): 1
let exponentiation = x ** y; // Exponentiation: 25
  
  
  
  
Assignment Operators:

Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.
Examples:

let x = 5;
let y = 10;

x += y;   // x = x + y: 15
x -= y;   // x = x - y: -5
x *= y;   // x = x * y: 50
x /= y;   // x = x / y: 0.5
x %= y;   // x = x % y: 5
  
  
  
  
Comparison Operators:

Comparison operators compare two values and return a Boolean result (true or false).
Examples:

let x = 5;
let y = 10;

let isEqual = x === y;      // Equality: false
let isNotEqual = x !== y;   // Inequality: true
let isGreater = x > y;      // Greater than: false
let isLess = x < y;         // Less than: true
let isGreaterOrEqual = x >= y;  // Greater than or equal to: false
let isLessOrEqual = x <= y;     // Less than or equal to: true
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
Logical Operators:

Logical operators are used to combine or negate conditions.
Examples:

let x = 5;
let y = 10;
let z = 3;

let result1 = x > y && x < z;  // AND operator: false
let result2 = x > y || x < z;  // OR operator: true
let result3 = !(x === y);     // NOT operator: true
  
  
  
  
  
  
String Operators:

String operators are used for concatenating strings.
Examples:

let greeting = "Hello";
let name = "John";

let message = greeting + " " + name;  // Concatenation: "Hello John"
These are some common operators in Node.js. They allow you to perform various operations on values, manipulate strings,
compare values, and assign new values to variables. 
By using operators effectively, you can perform calculations, make decisions, and create dynamic behaviors in your code.

Here are the different types of operators in Node.js with some code samples to illustrate their use:

Arithmetic Operators:
  
  These operators are used to perform arithmetic operations on numbers. 
  The following are the arithmetic operators in Node.js:
   var x = 10;
   var y = 5;

   console.log(x + y); // Output: 15
   console.log(x - y); // Output: 5
   console.log(x * y); // Output: 50
   console.log(x / y); // Output: 2
   console.log(x % y); // Output: 0
   console.log(x ** y); // Output: 100000
    
    
Comparison Operators:
  
  These operators are used to compare two values.
  They return a boolean value indicating whether the comparison is true or false. 
The following are the comparison operators in Node.js:
   var x = 10;
   var y = 5;

   console.log(x == y); // Output: false
   console.log(x != y); // Output: true
   console.log(x > y); // Output: true
   console.log(x < y); // Output: false
   console.log(x >= y); // Output: true
   console.log(x <= y); // Output: false
    
    
    
    
    
Logical Operators:
  
  These operators are used to combine multiple conditions and return a boolean value. 
The following are the logical operators in Node.js:
   var x = 10;
   var y = 5;
   var z = 7;

   console.log(x > y && x < z); // Output: false
   console.log(x > y || x < z); // Output: true
   console.log(!(x > y)); // Output: false
    
    
    
    
Bitwise Operators: 
  
  These operators are used to perform bitwise operations on numbers. 
  The following are the bitwise operators in Node.js:
   var x = 5; // 0101
   var y = 3; // 0011

   console.log(x & y); // Output: 1 (0001)
   console.log(x | y); // Output: 7 (0111)
   console.log(x ^ y); // Output: 6 (0110)
   console.log(~x); // Output: -6 (1010)
   console.log(x << 1); // Output: 10 (1010)
   console.log(x >> 1); // Output: 2 (0010)
