In Ruby, the convention of using methods with an equal sign (`=`) at the end of the method name is known as a "setter" method, and it is used to set the value of an instance variable. Similarly, a method without an equal sign is known as a "getter" method, and it is used to retrieve the value of an instance variable. These conventions are used for encapsulation, and they help ensure that data access is controlled and consistent.

Here's the difference between a setter method with an equal sign and a regular method without it:

1. Setter Method (with `=`):

   ```ruby
   def make=(text)
     @make = text
   end
   ```

   This is a setter method. It is used to set the value of the `@make` instance variable. You can use it like this:

   ```ruby
   car = Car.new
   car.make = "Toyota"
   ```

   In this case, you are assigning the value "Toyota" to the `@make` instance variable.

2. Getter Method (without `=`):

   ```ruby
   def make
     @make
   end
   ```

   This is a getter method. It is used to retrieve the value of the `@make` instance variable. You can use it like this:

   ```ruby
   car = Car.new
   car.make # This retrieves the value of the `@make` instance variable.
   ```

   In this case, you are reading and returning the value of the `@make` instance variable.

The key distinction is that setter methods are used to change the value of an instance variable, and getter methods are used to read the value of an instance variable. The use of the `=` sign in a setter method is a convention to indicate that the method is for assignment, while the absence of the `=` sign in a getter method is a convention to indicate that the method is for retrieval.

These conventions help maintain a clear and consistent interface for working with instance variables in objects and allow you to control how data is accessed and modified within your class.






















  

what about  a maethod like def name(text)  puts "Your name is #{name}" end , in the above class, what will this method be , nand how will it be used, 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



  In the class you provided earlier, if you define a method like `def name(text)`, it would be a regular method that takes one argument (`text`) and prints a message containing the value of the argument. However, there's a small issue with the code you provided: you should use `text` inside the `puts` statement instead of `name` to reference the method parameter. Here's the corrected code:

```ruby
class Car
  # A writer method. Sets the value of the @make attribute
  def make=(text)
    @make = text
  end

  # A reader method. Returns the value of the @make attribute
  def make
    @make
  end

  # Custom method that takes an argument and prints a message
  def name(text)
    puts "Your name is #{text}"
  end
end
```

Now, let's see how you can use this `name` method:

```ruby
car = Car.new
car.make = "Toyota"  # Setting the make using the setter method
puts car.make        # Retrieving the make using the getter method
car.name("John")     # Calling the custom method with an argument
```

In this example, you create an instance of the `Car` class, set the `make` attribute using the setter method, retrieve the `make` attribute using the getter method, and then call the `name` method, passing "John" as an argument. The `name` method will print "Your name is John" to the console.

The `name` method is a custom method that is not related to the `@make` attribute. It's just a method you've defined in the class to perform a specific task, which is printing a message based on the argument provided to it.
