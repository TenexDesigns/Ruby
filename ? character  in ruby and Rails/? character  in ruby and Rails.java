In Ruby, the `?` character is used to denote methods that return a boolean (true or false) value. It's a common naming convention in Ruby and is used to make the purpose and behavior of the method clear.

Here are a couple of common ways the `?` character is used in Ruby and Rails:

1. Predicate Methods:
   In Ruby, methods ending with `?` are often used to indicate that they return a boolean value and are used to query the state or status of an object. For example:

   ```ruby
   # Check if a string is empty
   empty = my_string.empty?

   # Check if a number is even
   even = some_number.even?
   ```

   Predicate methods are used to ask questions about the state of an object or to test conditions. The `?` in their names makes it clear that they return a boolean value.

2. Ternary Operator:
   In conditional expressions, `?` is used as part of the ternary operator. For example:

   ```ruby
   condition ? true_value : false_value
   ```

   In this context, the `?` is used to represent a condition. If the condition is true, the expression returns `true_value`; otherwise, it returns `false_value`.

In Ruby on Rails, the `?` character is commonly used in the context of query methods and boolean checks, particularly when working with ActiveRecord and databases. For example:

```ruby
# Check if a record with a specific ID exists
exists = User.exists?(1)

# Find a record with a specific condition
user = User.find_by(username: "example")  # Returns nil if not found

# Check if a user is an admin
is_admin = user.admin?
```

In these examples, the `?` character helps make it clear that the methods are related to querying or checking conditions, returning true or false results.

Overall, the `?` character is a convention that enhances code readability and understanding by indicating the boolean nature of a method or its association with a condition or query.
