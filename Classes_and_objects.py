In Ruby, classes and objects form the foundation of object-oriented programming.
A class is a blueprint that defines the attributes (variables) and behaviors (methods) of objects.
Objects are instances of classes that can hold data and perform operations.
Heres an explanation of classes and objects in Ruby with code samples:

  
  
  
Class Definition:

Use the class keyword to define a class.
Example:
ruby
Copy code
class Person
  # Class code goes here
end





Creating Objects (Instances):

Use the new method to create objects (instances) of a class.
Example:

person1 = Person.new
person2 = Person.new






Instance Variables:

Instance variables hold the state or attributes of an object.
They are prefixed with @ and are accessible throughout the class.
Example:

class Person
  def initialize(name, age)
    @name = name
    @age = age
  end
end

person = Person.new("John", 25)



Methods:

Methods define the behaviors of objects. They are defined within the class and can be invoked on objects.
Example:

class Person
  def initialize(name, age)
    @name = name
    @age = age
  end

  def greet
    puts "Hello, my name is #{@name} and I am #{@age} years old."
  end
end

person = Person.new("John", 25)
person.greet








Accessor Methods:

Accessor methods provide access to instance variables from outside the class.
They are commonly used to get or set the values of attributes.
Example:

class Person
  def initialize(name, age)
    @name = name
    @age = age
  end

  def name
    @name
  end

  def age=(new_age)
    @age = new_age
  end
end

person = Person.new("John", 25)
puts person.name
person.age = 30
In Ruby, classes serve as blueprints, and objects are created based on those blueprints.
Objects encapsulate data (instance variables) and behavior (methods).
By defining classes and creating objects, you can model real-world entities, organize code, and achieve modularity and reusability.









MORE EXPLANATION
*******************************************************************************************************************************


In Ruby, a class is a blueprint from which objects are created. An object is also known as an instance of a class. 
Ruby is an object-oriented programming language, and it has features like data encapsulation,
polymorphism, inheritance, data abstraction, and operator overloading geeksforgeeks.org.

Defining a class in Ruby:

To define a class in Ruby, use the class keyword followed by the name of the class.
The first letter of the class name should be in capital letters.

class Class_name
end
Creating Objects using the "new" method in Ruby:

Objects can be created using the new method. You can create multiple objects from a single class.

object_name = Class_name.new
Defining Methods in Ruby:

Member functions in Ruby are called methods.
You can define methods using the def keyword followed by the method name. 
The method name should be in lowercase and terminated with the end keyword.

def method_name
  # method body
end
Here's an example using a Box class:

class Box
  @@no_of_color = 3
end

sbox = Box.new
nbox = Box.new
In this example, we define a Box class with a class variable @@no_of_color.
We then create two objects, sbox and nbox, from the Box class geeksforgeeks.org.

In Ruby, all objects inherit from the Object class.
The Object class is the default root of all Ruby objects and has methods available to all classes unless explicitly overridden

Sure, here are some examples of how to use classes and objects in Ruby:

Classes

A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the properties and methods that all objects of that class will have.

Ruby
class Dog
  attr_accessor :name, :age

  def initialize(name, age)
    @name = name
    @age = age
  end

  def bark
    puts "Woof!"
  end
end

Objects

An object is an instance of a class. It has the properties and methods defined by its class.

Ruby
sparky = Dog.new("Sparky", 10)

puts sparky.name # => Sparky
puts sparky.age # => 10
sparky.bark # => Woof!
Use code with caution. Learn more
Here are some additional things to note about classes and objects in Ruby:

Classes are defined using the class keyword.
Objects are created using the new method.
Objects can access their properties and methods using the dot notation.
Objects can call methods on themselves using the self keyword.
I hope this helps!
