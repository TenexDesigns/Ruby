In Ruby, you are correct that you have more flexibility when it comes to the data types of function parameters. Ruby is dynamically typed, which means you don't specify the data type of a parameter explicitly. This flexibility can be powerful, but it can also lead to runtime errors if you're not careful.

To avoid type errors in Ruby, you can follow these practices:

1. **Use Descriptive Variable Names**: Use variable names that clearly indicate the expected data type. For example, if a parameter should be an integer, name it something like `num` to suggest it should contain a number.

2. **Type Checking**: You can perform type checking explicitly using methods like `is_a?` or `kind_of?` to check the type of an object. For example:

   ```ruby
   def add_numbers(num1, num2)
     if num1.is_a?(Integer) && num2.is_a?(Integer)
       return num1 + num2
     else
       raise ArgumentError, "Both parameters must be integers"
     end
   end
   ```

   This code checks that both `num1` and `num2` are integers before proceeding with the addition.

3. **Documentation**: Use comments or method documentation to describe the expected data type of parameters. This helps other developers understand how to use your methods correctly.

4. **Error Handling**: Implement error handling to catch and handle type errors gracefully. You can use `begin` and `rescue` blocks to capture exceptions and respond to them.

   ```ruby
   begin
     result = add_numbers("1", 2)
     puts result
   rescue ArgumentError => e
     puts "Error: #{e.message}"
   end
   ```

5. **Unit Testing**: Write unit tests for your functions to ensure that they behave correctly with different data types. Testing can catch many issues before they become runtime errors.

6. **Use Explicit Type Conversions**: When necessary, you can use explicit type conversions to ensure that a variable is of the expected type. For example, you can use `to_i` to convert a string to an integer.

   ```ruby
   num = "42".to_i
   ```

7. **Design for Flexibility**: Consider making your methods flexible enough to handle different data types gracefully. For example, you can design a method to handle both integers and floats.

Overall, while Ruby provides flexibility in terms of data types, it's important to follow good coding practices, document your code, and use checks and tests to ensure that your code behaves as expected.
