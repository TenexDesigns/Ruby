In Ruby, attr_accessor is a class macro that generates getter and setter methods for instance variables.
It provides a convenient way to define attributes with read and write access in a class.
Heres an explanation of attr_accessor in Ruby classes with code samples:

Using attr_accessor:

To use attr_accessor, you include it within the class definition followed by the names of the instance variables you want
to create getter and setter methods for.
Example:

class Person
  attr_accessor :name, :age
end
Accessing Attributes:

With attr_accessor, you can directly access and modify the values of the specified 
instance variables using the generated getter and setter methods.
Example:

person = Person.new
person.name = "John"  # Setter method
puts person.name      # Getter method
Getter and Setter Methods:

attr_accessor creates both getter and setter methods for the specified instance variables.
The getter method allows you to retrieve the value of the instance variable,
while the setter method allows you to assign a new value to it.
Example:

person = Person.new
person.name = "John"     # Setter method
puts person.name         # Getter method
person.age = 25          # Setter method
puts person.age          # Getter method

Using attr_accessor saves you from writing explicit getter and setter methods for each attribute.
It simplifies the process of defining and accessing instance variables within a class.
Additionally, attr_accessor can be useful when you want to provide read and write access to instance variables without explicitly defining getter and setter methods.

attr_accessor is a Ruby method that generates getter and setter methods for instance variables within a class. 
It is a shortcut for declaring getter and setter methods for instance variables, 
making them accessible from outside the class stackoverflow.com.

Heres an example using attr_accessor:

class MyClass
  attr_accessor :variable_one, :variable_two

  def initialize(param_one, param_two)
    @variable_one = param_one
    @variable_two = param_two
  end
end

new_instance = MyClass.new("one", "two")
new_instance.variable_one = "new string"
new_instance.variable_one # => "new string"
new_instance.variable_two # => "two"
In this example, attr_accessor is used to create getter and setter methods for the instance
variables @variable_one and @variable_two. This allows us to set and get the values of these 
instance variables from outside the class medium.com.

Sure, attr_accessor is a Ruby method that can be used to create both
getter and setter methods for an instance variable. 
This means that you can access and modify the instance variable from outside the class.

For example, the following code creates a class called Person with an instance variable called name:

Ruby
class Person
  attr_accessor :name
end
Use code with caution. Learn more
You can then create an object of the Person class and access and modify the name instance variable:

Ruby
person = Person.new
person.name = "John Doe"
puts person.name # => John Doe
Use code with caution. Learn more
You can also use attr_accessor to create a getter method only or a setter method only.
For example, the following code creates a class called Car with a getter method for the speed instance variable:

Ruby
class Car
  attr_reader :speed
end
Use code with caution. Learn more
You can then create an object of the Car class and access the speed instance variable:

Ruby
car = Car.new
car.speed = 60
puts car.speed # => 60
Use code with caution. Learn more
The attr_accessor method is a very convenient way to create getter and setter methods
for instance variables. It can save you a lot of time and code.

Here are some additional things to note about attr_accessor:

The attr_accessor method can be used to create getter and setter methods for any instance variable.
The attr_accessor method can be used to create a getter method only or a setter method only.
The attr_accessor method is a very convenient way to create getter and setter methods for instance variables.
