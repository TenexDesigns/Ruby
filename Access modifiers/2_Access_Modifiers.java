In Ruby and Rails, you can use accessor modifiers to control the visibility of methods. These modifiers include `public`, `private`, and `protected`. By default, all methods (including accessor methods) are public in Ruby.

Here's a brief explanation of each modifier:

1. **Public**: Public methods can be called by any object. They form the "public interface" of your class and are meant to be called by other objects.

2. **Private**: Private methods can only be called within the context of the current object (they're only accessible from other code inside the object). You cannot access another instance's private methods directly.

3. **Protected**: Protected methods are accessible from other objects of the same class. They're often used in inheritance hierarchies.

Here's an example of how you might use these modifiers in a Ruby class:

```ruby
class MyClass
  def public_method
    'I am public!'
  end

  private

  def private_method
    'I am private!'
  end

  protected

  def protected_method
    'I am protected!'
  end
end
```

In this example, `public_method` is a public method, `private_method` is a private method, and `protected_method` is a protected method.

In the context of Rails, these modifiers are often used to control the visibility of controller actions. For example, you might have a `set_user` method that you use as a `before_action` in your controller. This method should be private, because it's not meant to be an action that responds to a request.

```ruby
class UsersController < ApplicationController
  before_action :set_user, only: [:show, :edit, :update, :destroy]

  # ...

  private

  def set_user
    @user = User.find(params[:id])
  end
end
```

In this example, `set_user` is a private method, so it can't be called as an action. It's only used internally by the `UsersController`.
