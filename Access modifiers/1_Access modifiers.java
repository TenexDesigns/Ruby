In Ruby and Ruby on Rails, there are several access control modifiers that determine the visibility and accessibility of methods and variables within classes. These modifiers help control the scope of methods and variables and ensure that they are not accessed or modified unintentionally. The main access control modifiers in Ruby and Ruby on Rails are:

1. `public`: Methods and variables defined as public are accessible from outside the class and can be called by any object or instance of the class. Public methods and variables are the default in Ruby.

```ruby
class MyClass
  def my_public_method
    # This method is public by default.
  end
end
```

2. `private`: Methods and variables defined as private are only accessible within the class where they are defined. They cannot be called from outside the class or by other objects of the class.

```ruby
class MyClass
  private

  def my_private_method
    # This method is private.
  end
end
```

3. `protected`: Methods and variables defined as protected are accessible within the class where they are defined and by other instances of the same class. They are not accessible from outside the class.

```ruby
class MyClass
  protected

  def my_protected_method
    # This method is protected.
  end
end
```

In Ruby on Rails, you might also encounter additional access control modifiers, such as `attr_accessible` and `attr_protected`, which are used for mass assignment security in models. These modifiers are used to specify which attributes can be assigned via mass assignment (e.g., when creating or updating records). However, it's important to note that these modifiers are primarily related to database security and not typical access control.

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  # This attribute can be mass-assigned.
  attr_accessible :username, :email
end
```

When using access control modifiers in Ruby and Ruby on Rails, consider the specific needs of your application and how you want to manage the visibility and accessibility of methods and variables. Public methods are accessible from anywhere, while private and protected methods are more restricted in their accessibility to ensure encapsulation and data integrity.
