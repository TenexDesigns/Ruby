Hashes and arrays are both useful data structures in Ruby, but they have different characteristics 
and are suitable for different scenarios. Here are some reasons why hashes can be considered better than arrays in certain situations:

Key-Value Pairing: Hashes allow you to associate values (the "values") with corresponding keys. 
  This key-value pairing provides a meaningful way to organize and access data.

# Using a hash to store information about a person
person = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  occupation: "Engineer"
}

puts person[:name]  # Output: John
Access by Key: Hashes provide efficient access to values based on their keys. Unlike arrays that use numeric indices, 
  hashes use keys for direct access, which can be more meaningful and intuitive.

# Accessing values from a hash using keys
person = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  occupation: "Engineer"
}

puts person[:age]  # Output: 30
Flexible Key Types: Hash keys can be of any object type in Ruby. This allows for greater
  flexibility when organizing and retrieving data.

# Using different types of keys in a hash
settings = {
  "color" => "blue",
  :size => "large",
  42 => "answer"
}

puts settings["color"]  # Output: blue
Associative Nature: Hashes naturally represent relationships between data. They are ideal when you need to store and retrieve data based on some meaningful connection or association between keys and values.

# Using a hash to store student grades
grades = {
  "Alice" => 90,
  "Bob" => 85,
  "Charlie" => 92
}

puts grades["Bob"]  # Output: 85
Easy Modification: Hashes provide methods to easily modify, add, or remove key-value pairs,
  making it convenient to update data as needed.

# Modifying a hash
person = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  occupation: "Engineer"
}

person[:age] = 31  # Changing the value for the key :age
person[:location] = "New York"  # Adding a new key-value pair

puts person  # Output: {:name=>"John", :age=>31, :occupation=>"Engineer", :location=>"New York"}
While hashes offer these advantages, arrays have their own strengths, such as ordered indexing and simplicity. 
The choice between using a hash or an array depends on the specific requirements of your program and the nature of the
data youre working with.
Its important to consider the characteristics of both data structures and choose the one that best fits your needs.

Hashes in Ruby are better than arrays in certain situations because they provide more flexibility 
in terms of key types and key-value associations. While arrays are indexed collections with integer keys,
hashes use any object as a key, allowing for more complex and dynamic data structures.

Here are some reasons why hashes are better than arrays in Ruby:

Flexible key types: In a hash, the key can be any object, while in an array, the key is always an integer. 
  This allows hashes to represent more complex relationships between data dev.to.
# Array example
colors = ["red", "green", "blue"]
colors[0] = "yellow"

# Hash example
color_names = {1 => "red", 2 => "green", 3 => "blue"}
color_names[1] = "yellow"
In this example, we can see that it's easier to change the "red" color to "yellow" using a hash, 
as we can directly update the value associated with the key "1". In an array, we would need to find
the index of the value and update it, which can be less efficient.

Better readability: Hashes can provide more context and readability when representing data with multiple attributes. 
  For example, when storing information about users, it's more intuitive to use a hash with keys 
  like :name, :age, and :city than to use an array with indices dev.to.
# Array example
users = ["Alice", 30, "New York"]
users[0] = "Bob"
users[1] = 31
users[2] = "Los Angeles"

# Hash example
user1 = {name: "Alice", age: 30, city: "New York"}
user1[:name] = "Bob"
user1[:age] = 31
user1[:city] = "Los Angeles"
Easier iteration: Hashes make it easier to iterate over key-value pairs,
  as you can use the each method to loop through the hash directly, whereas with an array,
  you would need to use indices and access elements by their position.
# Array example
users = ["Alice", 30, "New York"]
users.each_with_index do |user, index|
  puts "#{index}: #{user}"
end

# Hash example
user1 = {name: "Alice", age: 30, city: "New York"}
user1.each do |key, value|
  puts "#{key}: #{value}"
end
In summary, hashes in Ruby provide more flexibility, better readability, and easier iteration compared to arrays,
making them a better choice for certain situations where you need to represent complex data structures
